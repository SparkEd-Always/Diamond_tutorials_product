# Figma Wireframe Guide - Journey 1: Admissions & Enrollment

## 🎯 **Core Screens to Design (Priority Order)**

### **1. Parent Portal (2 hours max)**
**Key Screens:**
- **Application Form** → Multi-step form (Personal Info → Academic Info → Documents → Payment)
- **Application Status Dashboard** → Track progress, view updates
- **Document Upload Interface** → Drag-drop with validation

**Figma Tips:**
- Use Figma's form components library
- Create reusable input field components
- Focus on mobile-first design

### **2. Admin Dashboard (1 hour max)**
**Key Screens:**
- **Applications Overview** → List view with filters (new, pending, approved)
- **Application Review** → Single application view with approval workflow
- **Enrollment Management** → Batch enrollment actions

## 🚀 **Quick Figma Workflow**

### **Setup (15 mins)**
1. Create new Figma file: "EdTech Admissions MVP"
2. Set up frame sizes: Desktop (1440px), Mobile (375px)
3. Create basic design system:
   - Colors: Primary blue, success green, warning orange
   - Typography: 2-3 font sizes only
   - Button styles: Primary, secondary, text

### **Design Process (1.5 hours)**

**Step 1: Application Form (45 mins)**

### **Figma Components to Use**
- **Auto Layout** → For responsive forms
- **Components** → Reusable buttons, input fields
- **Variants** → Different button states
- **Prototype** → Basic click-through flow

## 📱 **Mobile Considerations**
- Stack form fields vertically
- Large touch targets (44px minimum)
- Progress indicator for multi-step forms
- Easy document camera integration

## 🎨 **Design Resources**
- Use Figma's Material Design or Bootstrap components
- Keep colors minimal: 1 primary + 1 accent color
- Focus on functionality over visual design

## ⚡ **Time-Saving Tips**
1. **Duplicate & Modify** → Copy similar screens, change content
2. **Use Templates** → Start with Figma community templates
3. **Low Fidelity First** → Boxes and text, add polish later
4. **Real Content** → Use actual school forms for reference

## 🎯 **Success Criteria (MVP)**
- Parents can complete application in 10 minutes
- Admin can review application in 2 minutes
- Mobile-friendly for parent usage
- Clear next steps at each stage
