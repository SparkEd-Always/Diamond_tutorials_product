## **Field Properties & Configuration**

Each field in the configurable system should support:

### 1. **Field Type**
- Text (single line)
- Text Area (multi-line)
- Number
- Date
- Dropdown/Select
- Radio Buttons
- Checkbox
- File Upload
- Email
- Phone Number

### 2. **Field Settings**
- **Required/Optional**: Toggle to make field mandatory
- **Label**: Customizable field name/label
- **Placeholder**: Helper text shown in empty field
- **Help Text**: Additional instructions/description
- **Default Value**: Pre-filled value (if any)

### 3. **Validation Rules**
- Min/Max length
- Min/Max value (for numbers)
- Format/Pattern (email, phone, etc.)
- Custom regex validation
- File size limit (for uploads)
- Allowed file types

### 4. **Display Configuration**
- **Display Order**: Admin can drag-and-drop to reorder
- **Section/Step**: Assign field to specific form step
- **Conditional Display**: Show/hide based on other fields
- **Width**: Full width, Half width, Third width

### 5. **Options** (for Dropdown/Radio/Checkbox)
- Predefined options
- Admin can add/edit/remove options
- Dynamic options from database (e.g., Classes, Academic Years)

---

## **Implementation Questions & Decisions**

### 1. **Field Customization**
Should admins be able to:
- ✅ Add custom fields beyond predefined list?
- ✅ Edit field labels (e.g., "Father's Name" → "Parent 1 Name")?
- ✅ Set custom validation rules?
- ✅ Create completely new field types?

**Recommendation**: Yes to all - maximum flexibility for schools

### 2. **Multi-step Form Configuration**
Should admins control:
- ✅ Number of steps (2-10 steps)?
- ✅ Step names/titles?
- ✅ Which fields appear in which step?
- ✅ Step order?

**Recommendation**: Yes - fully customizable wizard

### 3. **Conditional Logic**
Examples:
- Show "Guardian Details" only if "Parents not available" = Yes
- Show "Sibling Details" only if "Has sibling in school" = Yes
- Show "Previous School" only if applying for Class 2+

**Recommendation**: Implement basic conditional logic (show/hide based on checkbox/radio)

### 4. **Data Storage Strategy**
Options:
1. **JSON Storage**: Store custom fields in JSON column
   - ✅ Flexible, no schema changes
   - ❌ Harder to query, validate

2. **Dynamic Tables**: Create field metadata table
   - ✅ Better querying, validation
   - ✅ Structured data
   - ❌ More complex implementation

**Recommendation**: Hybrid approach - predefined fields in columns, custom fields in JSON

### 5. **Templates & Presets**
Should we provide:
- ✅ **CBSE Standard Template** (pre-configured CBSE school form)
- ✅ **ICSE Standard Template** (pre-configured ICSE school form)
- ✅ **State Board Template** (state-specific requirements)
- ✅ **Minimal Template** (basic fields only)
- ✅ **Start from Scratch** (blank canvas)

**Recommendation**: Yes - templates speed up configuration
