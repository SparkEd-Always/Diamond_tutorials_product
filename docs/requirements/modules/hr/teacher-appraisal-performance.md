# Teacher Appraisal & Performance Management Requirements

## User Story
As a principal/academic head, I want to implement comprehensive teacher performance evaluation using digital observation tools and 360-degree feedback systems so that we can provide constructive feedback, support professional growth, recognize excellent performance, and ensure quality education delivery.

## Actors
- **Principal** → Sets performance standards, conducts evaluations, makes promotion decisions
- **Academic Head** → Coordinates evaluation process, provides feedback, plans development programs
- **Department Heads** → Evaluate department teachers, set goals, monitor progress
- **Teachers (Evaluees)** → Participate in evaluations, set goals, implement feedback, document achievements
- **Students** → Provide anonymous feedback, participate in teaching effectiveness surveys
- **Peer Teachers** → Conduct peer observations, share best practices, provide colleague feedback

## Journey (Steps)

### 1. Performance Framework Setup
- Define evaluation criteria and performance indicators
- Set up evaluation cycles and timeline schedules
- Assign evaluators and establish review committees
- Configure goal-setting templates and career development paths

### 2. Goal Setting & Planning

- Align personal goals with institutional objectives
- Define measurable outcomes and success metrics
- Create professional development plans and timelines

### 3. Continuous Monitoring & Feedback
- Conduct regular classroom observations and teaching assessments
- Collect student feedback and academic performance data
- Document achievements, challenges, and improvement areas
- Provide ongoing coaching and mentorship support

### 4. Formal Evaluation & Review
- Conduct mid-year and annual performance reviews
