# Classroom & Lab Scheduling Requirements

## User Story
As a facilities coordinator/academic administrator, I want to efficiently manage classroom and laboratory scheduling using automated booking systems so that academic activities run smoothly without conflicts while maximizing facility utilization and supporting diverse learning needs.

## Actors
- **Facilities Coordinator** → Manages overall facility scheduling, resolves booking conflicts, optimizes resource utilization
- **Lab Manager** → Coordinates laboratory access, manages equipment, ensures safety compliance
- **Academic Administrator** → Approves facility usage, integrates with academic calendar, manages access permissions
- **Subject Teachers** → Book classrooms and labs, specify equipment needs, conduct classes
- **Lab Technicians** → Prepare equipment, maintain laboratory setup, assist with technical requirements
- **Students** → Attend classes in scheduled facilities, use laboratory equipment, follow safety protocols

## Journey (Steps)

### 1. Facility Setup & Configuration
- Define classroom and laboratory capacities, equipment, and capabilities
- Set up booking rules, access permissions, and usage policies
- Configure equipment inventory and maintenance schedules
- Establish priority levels for different types of academic activities

### 2. Booking & Reservation Management
- Process room booking requests from teachers and departments
- Check availability and resolve scheduling conflicts
- Allocate specialized equipment and technical support
- Generate booking confirmations and access instructions

### 3. Resource Optimization & Allocation
- Optimize room assignments based on class size and requirements
- Coordinate equipment sharing and maintenance schedules
- Handle last-minute changes and emergency reallocations
- Monitor facility utilization and identify optimization opportunities

### 4. Access Control & Security
- Manage access permissions for different user groups
- Control equipment usage and security protocols
- Track facility usage and maintain security logs
- Handle key management and electronic access systems

### 5. Maintenance & Quality Assurance
- Schedule regular maintenance and equipment servicing
