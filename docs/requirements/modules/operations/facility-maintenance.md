# Facility Maintenance Requirements

## User Story
As a facilities manager/maintenance supervisor, I want to efficiently manage preventive and corrective maintenance using automated scheduling and IoT monitoring so that facilities remain safe, functional, and conducive to learning while optimizing maintenance costs and minimizing disruptions.

## Actors
- **Facilities Manager** → Plans maintenance schedules, manages budgets, coordinates with contractors
- **Maintenance Supervisor** → Oversees daily maintenance, assigns work orders, ensures quality control
- **Technicians** → Execute maintenance tasks, report issues, update work order status
- **School Administrator** → Approves maintenance budgets, sets facility policies, monitors compliance
- **Students & Staff** → Report maintenance issues, follow safety protocols, provide facility feedback
- **Maintenance Contractors** → Provide specialized services, perform major repairs, maintain equipment warranties

## Journey (Steps)

### 1. Asset Registration & Inventory Management
- Maintain comprehensive inventory of all school infrastructure and equipment
- Register asset details, warranties, service requirements, and specifications
- Track asset location, condition, and maintenance history
- Set up depreciation schedules and replacement planning

### 2. Preventive Maintenance Planning
- Define maintenance schedules based on manufacturer recommendations
- Plan periodic inspections and service activities
- Allocate resources and schedule maintenance teams
- Coordinate with academic calendar to minimize disruptions

### 3. Work Order Management & Execution
- Process maintenance requests from staff and departments
- Prioritize work orders based on urgency and impact
- Assign technicians and track work progress
- Manage contractor coordination and vendor relationships

### 4. Issue Tracking & Resolution
- Record and categorize maintenance issues and complaints
- Track resolution time and service quality
- Implement corrective actions and process improvements
- Maintain detailed logs of all maintenance activities

### 5. Compliance & Safety Management
- Ensure compliance with safety regulations and building codes
- Conduct regular safety inspections and audits
- Manage permits, certificates, and regulatory documentation
- Implement emergency maintenance procedures

## Pain Points
- **Reactive Maintenance**: Costly breakdown repairs due to inadequate preventive maintenance
- **Poor Coordination**: Maintenance activities disrupting academic schedules
- **Inventory Challenges**: Difficulty tracking spare parts and maintenance supplies
- **Vendor Management**: Complex coordination with multiple contractors and suppliers
- **Documentation Gaps**: Incomplete maintenance records affecting warranty claims
- **Budget Overruns**: Unexpected maintenance costs due to poor planning
- **Safety Risks**: Delayed repairs creating safety hazards for students and staff
- **Communication Issues**: Poor reporting of maintenance issues and completion status

## Opportunities
- **Predictive Maintenance**: IoT sensors and AI for predicting equipment failures
- **Mobile Work Orders**: Mobile apps for technicians to receive and update work orders
- **Automated Scheduling**: Smart scheduling based on priority, resources, and academic calendar
- **Vendor Portal**: Online platform for contractor management and communication
- **Digital Documentation**: Paperless maintenance records with photo and video documentation
- **Energy Management**: Smart systems for optimizing energy consumption and costs
- **Emergency Response**: Rapid response systems for critical maintenance issues

## Inputs
- **Asset Information**: Equipment specifications, installation dates, warranty details, locations
- **Maintenance Requests**: Issue reports from staff, students, and routine inspections
- **Service Schedules**: Manufacturer recommendations, regulatory requirements, institutional policies
- **Vendor Details**: Contractor capabilities, service agreements, contact information
- **Budget Allocations**: Maintenance budgets, cost centers, approval limits
- **Safety Standards**: Building codes, safety regulations, compliance requirements
- **Academic Calendar**: Class schedules, exam periods, holiday periods for maintenance planning

## Outputs
- **Work Orders**: Detailed maintenance tasks with specifications and resource requirements
- **Maintenance Schedules**: Planned maintenance calendar with resource allocation
- **Asset Reports**: Equipment condition assessments and replacement recommendations
- **Compliance Certificates**: Safety inspections, regulatory compliance documentation
- **Cost Analysis**: Maintenance cost tracking and budget variance reports
- **Performance Metrics**: Service level statistics and technician performance data
- **Emergency Procedures**: Rapid response protocols for critical maintenance issues

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Preventive maintenance reduces emergency repairs by 40% compared to reactive approach
- [ ] Work order system assigns tasks automatically based on priority and technician availability
- [ ] Mobile app enables technicians to update work status in real-time
- [ ] Asset tracking maintains 99%+ inventory accuracy with automated alerts for low stock
- [ ] Maintenance requests receive response within 4 hours for urgent issues
- [ ] Compliance tracking ensures 100% up-to-date certifications and inspections
- [ ] Cost tracking provides real-time budget utilization and variance analysis
- [ ] Integration prevents maintenance scheduling conflicts with academic activities
- [ ] Emergency response system activates within 15 minutes of critical issues
- [ ] Historical data maintains 7+ years of maintenance records for warranty and audit purposes

## System Interactions
- **Asset Management**: Track equipment lifecycle and replacement planning
- **Academic Calendar**: Coordinate maintenance schedules with school activities
- **Purchasing System**: Manage procurement of spare parts and maintenance supplies
- **Vendor Management**: Coordinate with external contractors and service providers
- **Budget Management**: Track maintenance costs against allocated budgets
- **Safety Management**: Report safety issues and track compliance requirements
- **Communication Platform**: Send maintenance notifications and status updates
- **Mobile Application**: Field technician access for work orders and updates
- **Document Management**: Store maintenance records, warranties, and certificates

## Edge Cases
- **Emergency Breakdowns**: Immediate response for critical infrastructure failures
- **Natural Disasters**: Emergency repairs and damage assessment procedures
- **Seasonal Maintenance**: Weather-dependent maintenance activities and scheduling
- **Utility Failures**: Coordination with utility providers for power, water, internet outages
- **Regulatory Inspections**: Unscheduled compliance audits and rapid response requirements
- **Contractor Disputes**: Alternative arrangements when primary vendors are unavailable
- **Budget Constraints**: Prioritization when maintenance needs exceed available budget
- **Technology Obsolescence**: Replacement planning for outdated systems and equipment
- **Safety Incidents**: Immediate response and investigation procedures for accidents
- **Multiple Site Management**: Coordinated maintenance across multiple campus locations

## Priority/Frequency
- **Priority**: High (Critical for safe school operations and regulatory compliance)
- **Frequency**:
  - Daily monitoring: Safety checks, urgent repairs, routine inspections
  - Weekly planning: Work order scheduling, resource allocation, vendor coordination
  - Monthly reviews: Preventive maintenance execution, budget analysis, performance assessment
  - Quarterly audits: Compliance verification, safety inspections, system optimization
  - Annual planning: Budget preparation, asset replacement, contractor negotiations
- **Peak Usage**: Semester breaks (major maintenance), extreme weather periods, pre-inspection periods
- **Critical Periods**: Monsoon season (building maintenance), summer breaks (major repairs), inspection seasons
