Now, I would like to discuss few things on implementation of requirements for Diamond tutorials:


A. Attendance:
Here we would like to send updates to parents through whatsapp as opposed to send it through the mobile app as we were doing it for AVM.

B. Fees and marks communication:
there are other items as well like fees and marks communication for which we will work later on as it will require more time and planning.

so, let's start executing attendance feature first.
