notification is working!!!!!!!!
I checked for both communication as well as attendance.

1. but when click on the notifiction I expect it to take me to that page in the approval
example if as a parent I click attendance notification, it should take me to attedance page in the mobile app and same with messages

but it is taking me to main/ home page 

2. the sparky icon is not showing up on the notification rather a dark blue icon shows







remove need help? section form 
the main/home page
make the Sparky from SparkEd match the background as opposed writing it on dark blue background in home/main page, in the login screen it is nice match that with the home or main page
carry the main color pallete throughout the mobile app code
