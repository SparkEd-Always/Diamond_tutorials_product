I used ChatGPT to generate a prompt for you so that it'll help you understand better what is my ask.
you update our entire codebase learning from the prompt


prompt generated by ChatGPT-->
Please propagate this palette consistently across my entire software — including Android theme XMLs, React/Tailwind (if web), and Figma token format if needed.
Use semantic naming (primary, surface, accent, success, etc.).


Here’s the palette JSON:
{
  "name": "SparkEd Theme",
  "colors": {
    "primary_blue": "#1A2E5C",
    "secondary_blue": "#2C4E8A",
    "background_top": "#16233E",
    "background_bottom": "#1E3664",
    "green_bookmark": "#3EE06D",
    "green_highlight": "#55F07A",
    "white": "#FFFFFF",
    "black": "#000000"
  }
}




Please:
	1.	Generate Android theme XMLs (colors.xml, themes.xml, etc.) using these colors.
	2.	Generate CSS variables / Tailwind config using consistent naming (e.g., --color-primary, accent-green, etc.).
	3.	Generate a Figma tokens JSON for the same.
	4.	Optionally, define a light and dark variant theme using tints/shades of these colors.
	5.	Ensure color harmony and accessibility (contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 for text).

Return all outputs in a single structured format (separated by section headings).

The goal: I should be able to drop these directly into my codebase and design system to maintain SparkEd’s brand consistency across web + Android.
