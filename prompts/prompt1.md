"Let’s focus on SparkED’s product development. The plan is to start by building an industry-standard ERP + SIS platform with a minimal LMS component. The goal is to use this first version to collect customer feedback, engage in service, and iterate for improvements. Please help me structure the development roadmap, industry benchmarks, MVP scope, and iteration plan for this phase."
