## 💡 Key Insights

### 1. SIS is Different
Unlike other modules that handle specific processes (admissions, fee, payroll), SIS is a **data repository** that:
- Stores data from all other modules
- Provides data to all other modules
- Acts as single source of truth
- Requires highest security and reliability

### 2. Multiple User Roles
SIS serves more user types than any other module:
- Admins (full access)
- Teachers (class data)
- Class coordinators (class monitoring)
- Parents (own children only)
- Students (own data only)
- Counselors (behavioral access)
- Nurses (medical access)
- Management (analytics)

### 3. Compliance Critical
SIS handles the most sensitive data:
- Personal information (name, DOB, address, Aadhar)
- Medical records (health conditions, medications)
- Academic records (grades, assessments)
- Behavioral records (discipline, counseling)
- Family information (parents, custody, emergency contacts)

**Result**: Strictest security, privacy, compliance requirements
